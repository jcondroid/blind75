Things to know and when to use them: 
    HashSet
    HashMap
        put
        getOrDefault
        containsKey
        get
        remove
    Map
        Map.of
        get
        containsKey
    Stack
        pop
        push
        peek
*Problems I think are easy:
Arrays
    ContainsDuplicate
*Problems I am feeling better about:
Arrays
    Valid Anagram - Not a lot of experience with HashMap
    Two Sum - Had issue before with returning an array of indices (its actually {easy})
2Pointers
    Valid Palindrome - Not a lot of experience with 2 pointers and some String manipulation involved
Sliding Window
    Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock - Seems trivial but the for loop required some thought
List
    Reverse Linked List - Had a really hard time visualizing the solution
*Problems I think are doable but need more practice:
Stack
    Valid Parenthesis - Requires use of Map
List
    Merge 2 Lists - Similar problem to Reverse Linked List but more involved
    Linked List Cycle - Same as above
Trees
    Invert Binary Tree - Swapping child nodes was new to me but straightforward
    Maximum Depth of Binary Tree - can't visualize how it works
    Same Tree - can't visualize how it all works
    Subtree of Another Tree - Use of strings. Would like to try this one again from scratch
DP
    Climbing Stairs - I think this is easy now that I know the solution but want to try again from scratch.
Intervals
    Meeting Rooms - Sorting with lambda is new for me in Java. Need more practice with intervals.
*Problems I think are hard:
Bit Manipulation
    Skipping this BS
